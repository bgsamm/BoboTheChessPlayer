# BoboTheChessPlayer

2022.07.28 
This project is an object oriented program that plays a game of chess. Ultimately, I want to use it as a way of developing heuristic ways of evaluating a position numerically, as an extension of the usual material count. If possible, I would like to develop similar point method for other key features of a position: king safety, piece activity, pawn structure, space
